# NeoVim Configuration Bistro

This is the repo for my current NeoVim configuration.

## Details

- Written in [Fennel](https://fennel-lang.org/)
- Extensive use of macros for a more lispy configuration
- Divided into _Recipes_ for groups of functionality
- Separate and buildable outside of NeoVim

## Motivation

I really enjoy NeoVim and I really enjoy lisp(s).

I also liked how Doom Emacs was configured with general groups of functionality that allow extra options to be specifed to enhance or change how that functionality works. This is my attempt at something somewhat similar.

I also did not want to rely on another plugin to allow me to write and update my configuration, so it is written in pure Fennel and exists entirely outside of NeoVim itself.

## Dependencies

- NeoVim (0.5+)
- Fennel
- VimPlug

## TODO

- [ ] Logo
- [ ] Readme
- [ ] Documentation and comments
- [ ] More/updated macros for function, syntax, etc.
- [ ] More recipes with more options for configuring
- [ ] Code clean up
- [ ] Speed enhancements and plugin lazy loading
- [ ] Probably other stuff I haven't though of yet...
